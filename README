# Compiling uperf

uperf uses the standard GNU build tools (`./configure;make`)


# Running uperf

1. The ./uperf can be run as either a master(active) OR slave(passive).
2. When run as active it needs  master flag(-m) with a profile describing
   the test application. Sample profiles have been provided which are
   sure to run, more and more application profiles are expected to be
   added defining the various test cases.
3. When run as the slave the program needs -s flag
4. By default we are using 20000 port as the master port.
5. We can set the verbose level, three level are provided
	1. (-V) High - all the messages are printed
	2. (-v) med - warnings and critical messages are displayed
	3. ( )  low - only critical messages are displayed.
6. Outputs: See usage for more information
